                                        <p>Jeremy is a life-long geek and tech addict. Originally from Texas, he has travelled extensively throughout the US during his career having visited and/or worked in all but Alaska and Hawaii.</p>
                                        <p>On his last assignment, he kept getting called "bullfrog" (Jeremiah...duh...never heard that one before...), it stuck and got adpoted as his Discord handle. So, here he is in all his magnificent glory...Da' Bullfrog ladies and gentlemen.</p>

                                    <p>Now residing in Florida, he enjoys the sunshine and being outdoors as much as possible. When not outside he’s deeply involved in learning new technology and techniques to stay on top of an ever-changing tech landscape. Jeremy likes to tinker with electronics as well and has so far managed to not catch anything on fire which is just...swell. He is also passionate about helping out local non-profits and …erm…cats.</p>

                                    <p>Having been a previous business owner, Jeremy had a hard time integrating into a team environment at first but has adjusted well and now prefers it over wearing all the hats and working alone. There's a but...you knew there would be...he has been threatened a few times (by employers and his wife) about his work-life balance. Old habits die hard, what's a body to do? The silver lining is he's a tenacious learner and problem-solving bulldog. Once he sinks his teeth into a project or problem, he's not going to let go without a path to resolution.</p>

                                    <p>This dude wrote his first computer program on a TI-99/4a when he was about 10 years old and was hooked. Jeremy has worked with many different frameworks and languages throughout the years and has a fondness for learning and applying new ones when the opportunity presents itself. He has worked mostly with JavaScript and PHP frameworks, HTML/CSS and PowerShell. He also has a knack and desire to use these to automate processes and tasks where possible. He has done this for Active Directory user creation, email and AD migration tasks, as well as hardware and software maintenance triggered via alerts produced by RMMs. </p>

                                    <p>Obviously, this guy has a particular passion for back-end tasks…but he is not without interest and experience when it comes to front-end work. He has worked as a customer facing web creator, photographer, and graphic designer with experience designing and creating screen print, heat press, and vinyl graphics merchandise as well as some product packaging (this last bit was in college).</p>
